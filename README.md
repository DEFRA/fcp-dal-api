## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v11`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd fcp-dal-api
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

To test the application run:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json).
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## API endpoints

| Endpoint       | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| `GET: /health` | Health      |

### Security

The platform provides features for handling authentication to the DAL, connecting clients can follow the [CDP docs](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/how-to/apis.md#how-do-clients-authenticate-and-access-my-api-).

> NOTE: the endpoint protection can be changed by submitting a PR with changes to this [spec file](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-tf-svc-infra/blob/main/environments/dev/apis/fcp-dal-api.yml)

## Development helpers

### Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. To make use of this: `import { fetch } from 'undici'` then because of the `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl))` calls will use the ProxyAgent Dispatcher

If you are not using Wreck, Axios or Undici or a similar http that uses `Request`. Then you may have to provide the proxy dispatcher:

To add the dispatcher to your own client:

```javascript
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici'

return await fetch(url, {
  dispatcher: new ProxyAgent({
    uri: proxyUrl,
    keepAliveTimeout: 10,
    keepAliveMaxTimeout: 10
  })
})
```

## Docker

### Development image

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag fcp-dal-api:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 fcp-dal-api:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag fcp-dal-api .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 fcp-dal-api
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- This service.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties)
