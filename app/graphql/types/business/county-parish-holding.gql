"""
County Parish Holding (CPH) number. A 9-digit identifier for
land or buildings used to keep livestock or places that
use animal by-products. Used for tracking and managing
livestock movements to help prevent and control disease.

The last 4-digits (e.g. 12/34/xxxx) will indicate the type: 0001-4999 are
standard CPHs. 7000-7999 are temporary. 8000-8999 are for non-agricultural
holdings (e.g. livestock markets, meat product plants, seaports).

A business can have zero, one or more CPH numbers.

Data Source: SitiAgri

Note that Animal Plant and Health Agency (APHA) also have a source of CPH data.
While RPA issues the CPH number to the customer, APHA is interested in CPH
for disease control, therefore they may have more up-to-date and granular
information on species, for example.
